# Delhi-Metro-java-Project


The core of this tool is a graph data structure, where each metro station is represented as a point (vertex), and each connection between stations is a line (edge). Using Dijkstra's algorithm, the tool calculates the shortest path between any two stations. Additional features include the ability to add or remove stations and connections, display the entire metro map, and list all available stations. By providing accurate and real-time information, this tool aims to improve the overall commuting experience for Delhi Metro users, making their journeys faster and more efficient.

 Key Features:
 
Graph and Heap Data Structures: The metro system is modeled using nodes and edges. Nodes represent metro stations. Edges represent the distances and costs between connected stations.

Shortest Path Algorithms: The program is implemented using Dijkstra algorithm to determine the shortest path between two stations.

Repository Structure:
 
Main.java: Contains the core logic and implementation of the metro route finder.
Heap.java: Contains the heap implementation used for efficiently finding the shortest path.
